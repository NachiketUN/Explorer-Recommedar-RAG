Convenience store Car wash Fast food restaurant Gas station Delivery In-store pickup In-store shopping, Mask required Safety dividers at checkout, Wheelchair accessible entrance Wheelchair accessible parking lot, Quick visit, NFC mobile paymentsLove this location - bright, clean, friendly staff, pretty tasty breakfast tacos, fountain drinks with lemon/cherry/vanilla/other flavors and 2 tall boys for $4. It‚Äôs like heaven - or it‚Äôs more like I imagine the gas stations IN heaven. Worth checking out, and better than other nearby gas station convenience stores by a country mile. Low, low gas prices! Regular, Mid-grade, Premium and Diesel gas are all low priced. They stay consistent with HEB and Walmart! Mobil offers a 20 cents per gallon discount if you pay for a carwash...this also includes the use of their many vacuums! Lots of gas pumps and very well-lit! Conveniece store is open 24/7. Very clean and the employees are friendly! I usually come here to wash my windshield because they keep it clean and well-stocked with a decent squeegee and 'the good' paper towels at each pump! You guys really need to trained your employees, rude and very unprofessional!!  Plenty of gas stations to go around too and make business I come weekly or more to this place usually fine did the hours change? I don't normally come late at all but thought 24 hours I could... Doors locked my glasses fogged I get back in car to leave another guy pulls up tries to go in. If hours changed that's fine but bummed I was not able to go today. I have been told verbally they are open 24 hours too so I'm stumped. I waited till my kid was finally sound asleep to come but nope can't purchase anything. Good carwash & employees! Specially a young man named Kevin! Always very helpful/ attentive. Supper disappointed.  Air used to be free (as it should be, after all it's air).  Now they are charging $1 for it.  So no big deal, went in to get change and asked for $2 worth of quarters, which to my surprise, I was not allowed!  So I said you're going to make me come back in again in a few minutes to get more change and she so NO, you can only use $1 worth of air.  Then she said, there's my Supervisor, you can take it up with him and he said the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, what's up with this?  I'm paying for it so why can't I have the $2 worth of air?  This makes no sense at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Used to go there to get my car washed but I will go somewhere else for my air and car washes. The employees are always nice here. They sell tacos, and donuts. I think Jondalar might be confusing them with Speedy Cash lol ridiculous employees do what they want with consumers, I spend at least $ 60 every day, they have no manners and treat wing people according as they see it, you know you forget it about\n",
      "not come here just Rached is a person without manners and lazy Car wash is not 24 hours. Bathroom always very clean\n",
      "Document 497:   Gas station Alternative fuel station ATM Convenience store Electric vehicle charging station Restaurant Wheelchair accessible entranceI was stopping at Home Depot so I visited thus Shell station while I was in the area. Gas price was resonaible.  They also have a Popeyes Chicken restaurant located just next door.  You can also enter the Shell Station threw the Popeyes Chicken restaurant if you chose or need too. Service was friendly and speedy. Horrible rude night staff that held the door open on my poor brother who suffers from crohn‚Äôs disease, while he used the bathroom. Never coming here again and I suggest you shouldn‚Äôt either. Good price on gas. Nice staff! Good gas station Staff unfriendly Tried to get a bottle of water when the inside was closed. Guy just stared at me.\n",

Timewise gastations are by far one of the best stores where you can find great bottled refreshments and coffee. They often run a tight ship everywhere, saying their all on the same page. But I‚Äôm wondering if some are franchise owned? This store location does a disservice to coffee drinkers, they don‚Äôt have a real milk cream machine unlike the other stores. So if you‚Äôre looking for a real coffee experience, you won‚Äôt get it here. Try going to another Timewise that has the milk cream machine. 1 star only because i can drive by & fill up in an emergency. This Gas Station used to be really nice! Courteous staff, all the pumps working... Now forget it!The staff should walk across the hall & apply @ McDonald's (don't they pay $15?),maybe that's why they've got attitude, they need a pay raise! I will go with my gas light on & drive another 5 miles if i have to before i stop here! Typical gas station, but worth the drive for the area. Lady who works there is rude as hell. It's a gas station\n",
      "Document 4333:   Gas station ATM Convenience store Restaurant Wheelchair accessible entranceNice place, micheladas are awesome Great inside store with very reasonable gas and food/beverage prices. At least 12 pumps with good entrances and exits. Clean It is very clean there. The variety of snacks is more healthy. They have a nice little place to sit and eat. I want to try their slushies next time I go. Overall, it's the best awesome gas station ever# Just opened.  Very nice.  Employees helpful and pleasant.  They have tables on the side. Shell Gas Station and store. Highly Recommended. The store is huge and clean. The bathroom is so nice. Good diesel fuel, but its about 10 cents higher if your paying with a card, better off paying cash. Friendly staff, have great variety in drinks/slushies. Has a eat in spot. Plus their normal gas station area. Is a little pricy. REAL home made ice cream you can taste the sugar, they have anything and everything to drink, patio outside to enjoy the BEST michalada, BEST menudo, the flour fajita tacos taste home made, Thier burgers are very juicy they have reg, jalapeno burgers, mango burger if you don't try and stop by you will be missing out on a good thing, live sports, racing Mexican music. Surprised me was mouthwash in the restroom Nicest in the area....great selection on drinks.....clean/fancy restrooms. Nice and clean gas station, food is good Very clean and organized gas station Better gas station in the area, wide selection of everything. I hate this store,racist Big store and clean Love this store has a lot of stuff Clean location Card reader doesn't work on some pumps. It's been too long and store doesn't care about fixing it.  Very inconvenient for customers in a hurry!!! Pretty good breakfast tacos Live having a new place in the neighborhood.

I live about 5-8 minutes away from this gas station. It‚Äôs always clean and well kept. A lot of options with it comes to beverages and snacks. It‚Äôs a great place for a quick stop. They have everything from instant f‚Äôreal shakes to a full on lunch kitchen. Well designed and well staffed. I started to give it five stars but I remembered that one time I bought an expired Naked smoothie there. Other than that 1 out of 1000 time mishap. All the while, always a great experience. Very clean. Staff are always very nice. Good gas prices. Well lit, convenient and store inside is large. This store is really clean. Good gas prices. They sell hot food from behind a clean counter and they wear gloves. And THE BEST ICE in Texas. Regular customer. Lots of convenient  location. Always friendly customer service personal. Prices are some times reasonable. I never have problems here. Staff is nice. And it's very clean. New modern, lots of food and drinks options. Try the morning taco, It's $2, but it's really a burrito. One is plenty. Always like stopping here on my way to work in the morning knowing they have fresh hot coffee and tasty breakfast tacos Good gas. Station has been open for about 8 months already. It's a nice store never know long wait it's always in and out It has the best ice.....clean and nice workers Clean! Big store and very clean!!! It's okay if there's food, there is a nice beer cave, and a Rockin Little Deli. Unfortunately I cannot get a discount on gas with my Kroger card. They have a little bit of everything to offer and the gas is only $1.99 a gallon. Best gas station I've ever attended Interesting gas station, there's a lot of different things in this place. Valero. The Shell is down the street. They're open 24 hours a day. Have every flavor of slushy known to man. In the morning they have a taco stand inside that has great tacos. Flour tortilla, Refried Beans, Huevos Mexicanas, Pico de Gallo, Cheese and Green Sauce, off the Chain. The guys that work behind the counter are super friendly. I love this place. Great cash gas prices and the food is very good made fresh everyday.  From sub sandwiches to hot food like pizza and etc. Decent gas station, very shady place at night. Service was great the food was awesome in the people was friendly I like it because it was the first clean shell that i have seen! Nice place really organized They have quick service to get gas Cool staff Got some smokes. Good  services Good gas Awesome Great Service and Location Courteous & fast service. Clean restrooms Good service Crushed ice is #1 Never been there before but heard that they have good food Gas Can't say I just hate the place it's just that i get harassed by people that posts up outside of the store...they even follow you in the store to continue their harassment. Nice Ok Best varity of drink s Clean restroom Clean restrooms I like Oasis convenience stores. Very clean! Love there drink selecting clean restrooms and friendly staff, the guy even ran off a transient who was asking for some change . never can be to careful these days (Translated by Google) I almost do not leave my route to go home, the traffic is difficult when I leave work and this time I had to go this way I had to buy gasoline that surprised this place an excellent option, cheap price, food and above all an excellent I try, the photos tell the other part of the story\n",

Michael-Sushi Master, Tuong-Sushi Chef, and Chau-Master Attendant, are our best friends when it comes to well prepared sushi. Come and ask them about our sushi addictions, they‚Äôll set you up quickly. We sit at the bar, sorry!!! Delicious. I ordered the king poke bowl with sushi rice. The tuna, salmon, cucumber and avocado were fresh. Would definitely recommend. I ordered to-go over the phone and had a great experience! The staff was friendly and obviously made all the food fresh to order. They even gave me a cookie on the house as a thanks for supporting them! I would definitely visit them again. It was my first time there and it was so worth it. You get a good portion of food. Very tasty glad I stopped here. Great service and friendly staff. I have been here several times and each was great. This time I got the sweet and sour chicken lunch special and it was so good I forgot to take a picture until I was halfway through üòÇ. My expectations were higher than I found,  I will say their taste is plain but the dish presentation is nice Great lunch spot\n",
      "Phenomenal service, food and restaurant was clean Fresher tasting than most, great selection, cozy, and fast They were closed when Google said it was open on Sunday.  Update your hours My go to for delicious asian cuisine in the kingwood area. Excellent customer service just makes their delicious seaweed salad and sushi unbeatable. Beer selection is really good too so go grab a drink! Food was a little plain....not much flavor. Everything seemed to be seasoned the same. Service good food fresh Service was great but food was bland and portions were small compared to the cost. One should have leftovers with Chinese food but there were none. Another negative: we could only do a Bento Box if we wanted Kung Pao or General Tsao's Chicken outside of the Lunch Menu rather than a full entree. The box with egg roll and dumplings were very small and the dirty rice wasn't dirty (pictured). On the plus side, service was friendly, smiling and helpful. We had lunch here today. Pictured is one of the Bento boxes. This place is so undiscovered. It was not busy and it should be! This is a Kingwood foodie must go. The star, IMHO, are the sauces. The sauce on my KungPao and my sons Orange Chicken was obviously well thought out and executed deliciously. Highly recommended. Excellent and so affordable! Service was fast and food choices were very good. Lunch menu had lunches with soup, salad, egg roll and rice. I enjoyed everything on the plate. Food was fresh and hot. I had the chicken and broccoli and had more than enough food! Food quality is always amazing and fresh. Love it just as much as the original Best poke ever We order over $90 worth of food. It was by far the most tasteless sushi we have ever had. It didn't taste like it was fresh. Gas Station Sushi would have been better than this. We barely ate half of our food. Also, there was no wasabi or ginger. I would love to have some ginger to get the taste of this sushi out of my mouth. We will never order food from here again. I've picked up at this location for doordash, several times. The food always smells great and the service is always good and fast.\n",
      "A couple weeks ago, I went for lunch with my mother-in-law and we both loved the food. The service was also good and I plan on going back. This is one of the best sushi places that I have been to.  The service is outstanding and it is very clean.  The quality of the food is well above what I expected and I will absolutely be back again.  I totally recommend coming here and giving them a try. I ate at this location a few days ago and was very satisfied with my order! The food was delicious. I ordered Fried rice and Gyoza and they both tasted great. The portions were perfect for lunch. I will definitely eat here again. Great prices. Fast service, clean place and restrooms. Fresh food, good portions, staff is very polite. Love the lunch specials. I usually get the ginger bowl or sashimi. It was super tasty. Staff was friendly and very attentive. Food came out quickly. Great menu options. Will return. Excellent sushi and sashimi! The wonton soup was perfect. Also, service was top notch and super friendly! Best sushi in Kingwood. Service was great but food was bland and portions were small compared to the cost. One should have leftovers with Chinese food but there were none. Another negative: we could only do a Bento Box if we wanted Kung Pao or General Tsao's Chicken outside of the Lunch Menu rather than a full entree. The box with egg roll and dumplings were very small and the dirty rice wasn't dirty (pictured). On the plus side, service was friendly, smiling and helpful. Very nice relaxed atmosphere, great sushi, soups, etc. Probably some of the best sushi in the area, the staff is very friendly. However I find their prices to be quite high, for 2 people you'll end up paying about $50USD without getting too much food. Would suggest to Ginger Cafe to revisit their prices. Good food, terrible restroom. Sushi is well done, orange and general chicken could be more crunchy, rice is soft , salads are fresh, poke bowls are fantastic well served presentation and hearty serving. I love this little gem in the middle of Kingwood. I always feel like family coming here. The food is so fresh and extremely tasty.  Try the vegetable tempura or a poke bowl or one of the overflowing bento boxes. You can't go wrong! Great place. Food was good- Sushi was fresh- Service was Excellent! So great to finally have quick & quality food from a local business rather than just another bland national chain in this neighborhood Good food.  Friendly Staff.  Good Japanese beer collection Food was delicious and portions were perfect - full without a ton of leftovers to deal with. The menu is varied with gyoza, sushi, poke bowls and bento boxes. We tried poke bowls and both my husband and I enjoyed them. They also gave us a sample sushi roll with crab and avocado that was yummy. We'll definitely be back! Good location. Nice staff. Food was ok. Definitely a great spot for lunch. I have to say, I do prefer their location in Atascocita, but this is a great addition to the Kingwood area. Great service and food, did I mention the service, let's be real most Asian places I'll have bean to service is not the menu. The food was ok, a little pricey, the service was very good. If I could give it a zero star I would! Food portions were horrible, food didnt all come out at the same time, and my beef and broccoli steak tasted like pot roast and my mom's steak was completely inedible.... I wouldn't even bring home leftovers home for my dad that's how nasty it was.... will not ever return! The food was ok, a little pricey, the service was very good. Great good and very nice staff! The Beno box are a great choice Great food at a very reasonable price Very good food.friendly atmosphere.neat and tidy  I gave them  5 stars because this place actually deserve 6 stars . Food was good, but those prices and portion you get RIDICULOUS will not be going back !!!! If your looking for places with this kinda food go else  where.  not worth the price  for the amount of little food you get , heck no and I like to spend a little extra if it's worth it, but not here We ordered the wonton soup, shaggy dog roll, rocket roll, and poke bowl. Everything tasted great. The price though. Ughhh. We would eat here a lot more if the price point could be reduced. But super good. Nice family owned restaurant serving both Japanese and Chinese dishes. Food is good, portion sizes though are a bit small. Pretty good, even had vegetable egg rolls on request. Pretty good, even had vegetable egg rolls on request. Very good food.friendly atmosphere.neat and tidy  I gave them  5 stars because this place actually deserve 6 stars . It was ok. I wasn't totally wowed. Food was ok, atmosphere was ok. Decent prices for decent food. So delicious! Crunchy Maki & Firework are so awesome!!!! I love this place!! Great food and service! Great food and service! I had the poke bowl with shrimp, crab, avocado, and edamame. It was really freakin' good and now I want it every day all the time. Love the King Poke bowl! I loved the sushi Good service Amazing, fresh and delish Sushi is excellent\n",

Their nuggets are better than McDonald's. Whopper is best sandwich only second after Whataburger...but even then..its close. Fish sandwich was very good. Chicken sandwich was okay..too pricey but still okay. Avoid at all costs. They are extremely slow and bad at making orders. I ordered a sourdough bacon king and was given a bun! So basically I paid the ‚Äúsourdough price‚Äù for a regular bacon cheeseburger. Hire more competent workers or just shut this place down. They have an extremely limited inventory, but not only that. I pulled up at 5am to place an order and I'm the only one in line, yet I waited for 15-20 minutes and no one has spoken or responded. Terrible service, half done food, and all around a waste of time based on a series of visits including this one. I finally drove up to the window to find out what's going on and learned they didn't have a cook. Like, is it too much to ask that they post a note on the box or even say we don't have a cook, closed, etc at the order box? Extremely unprofessional. Super slow. R u sure it is a fast food. Took more than 5 mins for drive through... gave both my hubby and I gas and we were NATIOUS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR 2 AFTERWARDS..NICE RUG PATH FROM OUR BEDS TO BATHROOM..UGHH 2 for $5 is a great deal and I didn't have to wait long.   Love my flame broiled burgers!! It would be nice... if when you order a ham EGG and cheese croissant...there was actually EGG in it. Really... Tried to get food by drive thru last night around 12, cashier came outside to my car and tried to fight me because I tried to get out of the line for waiting 15min...Good thing my girl was passenger if not we would of had problems. Never coming back again. Get new staff and train better Burger King on Mills! Smh Pretty good on the service . Most of the tme food is nice & fresh - wrm üëçüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏\n",
      ". The service was to slow and the people working took there sweet time I wouldn't come here again My family and I usually go to this particular Burger King simply because it close to home and calm the majority of the time and my boys play comfortably.\n",
      "Today when I took my boys with my parents we couldn't sit in the play area because it was filthy. We cleaned a table and sat in the main dining area even though it was dirty all over. Ever since they added the new manager  everything has gone down hill for that Burger King. Such a shame! We will not be returning till we see change. I love burger king. Cashier's could learn to use some manners. 2 days in a row they messed up my order! The 1st day they forgot my spicy chicken nuggets. I went back in the store and they gave me an extra 2 for the mistake, which I was happy about. The 2nd day I got 2 orders of the 8 piece spicy chicken nuggets and I got one set spicy and other regular. I hate being that guy that checks the bag before I leave the drive through window, but it looks like I need to now. Drive thru lady was laughing while she's was taking my order  without putting attention, also make me repeat words 2 / 3 times, and always are runing out of something ! Quick drive thru service... The Rodeo Burgers are AWESOME! The place is filthy always a wait that is to long it's obvious the store manager and district manager careless about running a clean restaurant they aren't the only ones but this is bad. Very nice and got my food on time Great Hot fast Food every time!!! Delish üòçüòçüòç It doesn't take much to inform your clients UPFRONT when you're out of something.\n",
      "It's the second time that I want to order the impossible Whopper and I'm told that you are out. Being vegetarian, there's nothing else I can order. So basically, I'm stuck in line for nothing. The Impossible Whopper is amazing! I love the regular Whopper, but the fake one is practically imperceptible. Burger King is truly royalty among fast food places with its whopping portion sizes and deliciously crafted items. The standard burgers are full of toppings, adding that extra touch. Flame broiled beef is the best thing that has ever been done to beef, and it smells delicious even as you drive within the waft zone of half a mile from any Burger King. Their fries are thick and taste like a potato is supposed to taste. Overall any establishment that hands out crowns is great in my book. Some of the best fast food out there really.\n",
      "The chicken fries taste good but won't fill you up.\n",
      "The bacon King burger or whatever it's called is really good if you are willing to pay the extra dollar. It's almost always hot and fresh tasting. They have some of the best fries tho. They aren't flimsy like McDonald's fries. Good food but suuuuuuuuper slooooooow !!! ....I won't come back to this location NO ONE ANSWERED AT THE DRIVE THRU FOR MINUTES 11/04/20 at 11:45PM Had the impossible whopper and it was pretty darn delicious. When ordering on app you really need to check the screen before driving away, it goes by fast so be on the look out. Awesome food of course! The drinks are watered down and no Ice but the food is good. The salads are ok but not as fresh as I would like Way to take pride in making a burger! Smh Slowest drive thru ever UPDATE:  3/1/20 This place says it's 24/7 but it's really not. I have been here on several occasions around 2 and 3 in the morning. After picking my friend up from work in the AMC strip center. There is no one inside the building. The person who runs the gas station next door doesn't know where the staff went either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Used to go by this BK all the time and give it 5 stars, though with the new manager lately. They don't care anymore. This only BK that's 24/7 for miles and the past 2 times I've been here in the AM, no one is inside or at the window.  Just empty. So what's the point of being open 24/7, lazy and no good. bring the old staff back. I like this restaurant. It shares a building with a 24/7 Mobil station. The contemporary dining room is neat and clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cashier was friendly. My order was ready right after I poured my fountain drink. The meal was very good. The hamburger bun was very fresh and the fries were cooked just right. Took a long tine to get order.  As I was sitting at window I saw two employees arguing. Not the drive they girl but the other two.  I got home whopper and fish sandwich was just thrown together.  Ugghh It took 28 min just to get food. It was a simple order. While the staff is huddle in one area and one dude working. The only guy that working was wear gloves, while the rest didnt have any gloves on. Pretty rude too 2 times  I get cold, burnt food We always ask for fresh and do not mind to wait but they make you wait and gave you old an stale food Service is kinda slow, but normal fast food. ZERO STARS!!!! MY HUSBAND AND I GOT FOOD POISONING FROM HERE. Great food and prices Fast Good burgers! Hadn't had one in years and I was pleasantly surprised. Very clean lobby area. Food was good, fresh and hot. I know moldy nasty tea when I taste it. I was an assistant manager for several food chains. Also grease is getting old. I will not be eating at this location until I see if the manager is making the employees do their jobs. Stop being lazy. Clean the ice machine and ice spout so the build up won't grow forms of mold. Also clean the tea containers or invest in bags. It is that simple. No tea should taste this old and nasty. Find employees that enjoy working. Those who do not take pride in their work won't be able to make customers satisfied. We do not want sloppy thrown together meals. The server at the front counter could not and would not get my order right. I asked for 2 items, and he got it wrong. He didn't make an effort to try to correct it. Tried the new impossible burger the taste was ok, but could definitely tell the difference, it's good for what it is tho I'm working night shift nearby so having a 24-hour Burger King on the way home is perfect! Except I have yet to be able to be served here. Twice in the last week I tried. First time, about 2:30 AM, the place is deserted, nobody working, not open at all. Second time also around 2:30 AM I drive up, wait a couple of minutes to get a response, then am told \"our system is down and I can't take any orders.\" Despite driving past this place, the closest BK to work, I won't be trying it again. Even during the daylight hours. Impossible burgers are good, and the onion rings and fries have improved and actually are good too. Tried the IMPOSSIBLE BURGER...haven't been to a fast food joint in years...THANK YOU for having a meat substitute!!!  DELICIOUS!!!! Great. However, you might want to do a little table clean-up before you sit. They are so slow The girl working the drive thru today at 3:45 P.M was AWFUL. Her name tag said 'Alacia'. I don't know where you get these people but for the love of God, would you please train them?! No customer service skills to be found! But so much rudeness and amount of aloof, it would drop jaws. Please take her off of drive thru because she has no idea what she's doing. Best breakfast to me just saying This location is the only Burger King location I'll ever go to in Houston. They are consistent in their customer service and quality. The food is always fresh and hot, the order is always accurate, and they have great attitudes! I'd give a 100 star rating if I could! Excellent! The manager has good employees and the food is good for fast good Horrible Burger King. They act as if they aren‚Äôt in the building. Even at 6:15 in the morning when they clearly say open. They are just lazy as hell & don‚Äôt wanna do they job & serve. I seen someone moving. I pulled up & walked in & nothing. This burger is horrible. Why are they here if they don‚Äôt wanna service people üôÑü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Customer service,  trash.  Rude. Came in during 2 different times and it was closed and the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù they were going to be for a while because they were taking the truck in. I didn‚Äôt see a truck anywhere Amazing Service, Amazing Food, Really Clean, It's all so great Was really good for a stop bye My order was correct, staff was very nice ...but the drive thru took a bit. This location is slow,  but i've not had problems.  The guy at the window is always nice Slow 3 nights in a row at 3 am and not taking orders why put 24 hours is you not going to be open? Okay food and price. I've had a few issues with this location. A few weeks ago I drove up to get the biscuit breakfast sandwich and although it's advertised on the menu board they told me that they didn't have any I had gone another time and I was told that it was discontinued. I called in to the Burger King customer support and they verified that in fact it was not discontinued and the manager for that store called me back and apologized to me explaining whatever she tried to explain although I recognize her voice from the person that took my order. I went today to give them one more chance and I ordered a number one which is the croissant sandwich with hash browns and coffee I ordered a large and was charged for a large. When I get to work to my surprise the hash browns were small and now the sandwiches much smaller than they used to be all of a sudden. I'm tired of Burger King and their mistakes and them ripping people off by minimizing the amount of food for the same price. I remember back in the days Burger King was the spot now we can see why Burger Kings are so slow nowadays and it'll get worse hopefully they close soon .Good food good price good service. Good service Its bk better than McDonald's Didn‚Äôt give me my sauce! How can you forget a persons sauce? Smh Drive-thrus open 24/7, so I always stop by on the way home for a good cheap late dinner. It was ok the bread bun was kinda oldstarted turning thick  but ok It's everything you expect from fast food Pretty good!!üòäüëçüèª States 24 hours but no one was working around 2am. 9/10/19 @2am. Friendly customer service hot fresh food Burgers are great. Customer service is rarely bad. Can't salt the fries to save their life, even when the fries are fresh Great customer service and my food was hot I love this place cuz they have the only flame-broiled fast food Burger around Always move slow this is supposed to be a FAST food restaurant on top of moving slow they always mess up the order New crispy chicken sandwich is pretty good. Ok normal fast food hey but don't get drunk in there ha ha they said no whoppa for you Great value. They have a self-serve icee machine. Very slow in store service.  Glacier advancing during global warming slow. Always Good when your Hungry.... Pretty place nice people Love burger king Open 24 hrs I came here and they closed for an hour because they received delivery from their food truck I love the icees Clean tables and food was made correctly to order Great customer service and delicious fresh food! Good Long wait...nice staff... Clean and quick... Messed up my order but food I got was good Good\n",

Tasty. I sat at the counter, only one in line, and watched 4 employees who knew I was standing there do nothing. I shrugged at one employee like, are you going to take my order and she point at another employee like it was the other guys responsibility. I ultimately walked out. Always convenient. Staff is very unfriendly Fast friendly Lobby closed early, The sign on the door says they close at 10 on Sunday. I go there at 8:50 and the lobby is closed.

Nothing out of the ordinary for a gas station franchise but never had a problem w my orders both breakfast & lunch.  Note: Smiles are greatly awarded with sincere smiles!  Doesn't hurt to be appreciative of their jobs It is a gas station place. Services is quite ok. Clean. That's my favorite Burger King right down the street from my house love them food always hot I like it the food is always fresh and they make it to order I'm very picky about my Burgers so they're always taking off for putting some ketchup and mayonnaise they're nice My favorite place to go I can always feed my kids off the coupon love it The drive thru window person had difficulty understanding plain English and very clear instructions regarding an extra coffee ordered in addition to 1 combo meals. Had to explain 3 times why our over was not complete and that when she told us the amount to pay it was less than it was supposed to be according to simple math calculations. So i hit a drive thru order 2 double cheese burgers and a med fry. Thats it, thats all just 2 double cheese burgers and a med fry. I had to order it 4 times at the drive thru because the young lady taking my order could not understand me, nor could I understand her reading it back to me. Got my order, thought 5 and some change was a little low but the King was on sale so maybe the doubles are too. Received 1 semi warm double cheese burger with a small half cold half warm fry. In other words I paid 5 dollars and some change for food I wouldn't feed my dog. Third world here we come... When you order you can't really here the cashier and they always get your order wrong then get mad at you for something they did wrong like not repeating the order. They litterly never even talked back to me while I was picking up a Togo order. I said the name and they just walked away. Had a coupon- buy a Whooper, get one free!! First time at this location but my breakfast sandwich was cold. Friendly staff though. I've eaten here before and the food was great but this time I wasn't satisfied. .99 so necessary Whopper meal was excellent. Great place. Fast food, no salad,garbage Great as usual Like the new jalapeno bombers. Drive thru line wasn't long. Very wonderful customer service, even when I see some rude customers, the employees still maintain a welcoming face! Hopefully people cut them some slack! Always love me a good ole Whopper from Burger King. Plus the 10pc nuggets is the best deal In town! It was great It okay place to eat Of all the Burger Kings this is certainly one of them Great new burger made of plants yet taste like beef its great i don't eat burger king but I was asked to give it a try and I wad astonished buy the new burger great job burger kingüíØüíØüíØüíØüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç Awesome Great new burger made of plants yet taste like beef its great i don't eat burger king but I was asked to give it a try and I wad astonished buy the new burger great job burger kingüíØüíØüíØüíØüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç Been going to this Burger King for years. It's always been a friendly environment with smiling staff speedy service. It's gotten a recent remodel and it's looking better than ever. A nice clean quiet Gas Station Burger King with wifi life is good I love their spicy chicken sandwich deal! The best I'm really disappointed,  bad service. Great service Cold food Whats to say that everybody on planet earth doesnt know?? Its just what u expect. Good, cheap, flame broiled burgers with a extremely unsettling looking mascot that makes somewhat weird commercials. My work is done here. Not sure what happend with my chicken sandwiches but for 6 dollars you would think it would be better than a dollar chicken sandwich wouldnt have gave it 2 stars if it wasnt for the smile i got pulling up to the drive thru I don't care for bk in general Order was wrong  twice and I had to return for what was forgotten. They ALWAYS close early!!! If you don‚Äôt make it by 10:30 nobody‚Äôs coming to the speaker WORST Burger King Good place to eat but could be better. Some times the customer service is not up to par I like their üêî sandwich on buttery buns. Place is grimy af. And staff always looks unkempt. Loved it and they were pretty nice Nice drive through service. Fast and my order with the coupon was perfect. They just missed my 5stars cause they lack a good spirit. You just need to smile,üòÅ. It's ok nice customer service üëç Never get it my way! üò°\n",
      "Meat not fresh cooked at high noon, Never can get mustard on the whopper ,on top of all that brown lettuce. Yuk\n",
      "Can't go back to try to get it done right , because I got 30 min lunch.ü§Æ Not tge greatest. Ok Their french toast bread sticks are tasty! Service was cool but once they messed my order up they took extremely long to correct it and my food got cold OMG love it! Whopper! Everything on it and Onion Rings so good! Food good bust customer service could certainly be better! Chicken fries are great and inexpensive ! Tables were clean and service was fast. Has the best grilled burgers for a fast food restaurant. Drive thru was fast but employee not friendly Getting better with customer service but slow on fixing orders. Breakfast wasnt hot. Lady was rude. She couldnt hear for anything and acted like she didnt want to be there or like her job. Took coupons without giveing discount and walked away when we were talking to her. Unacceptable! Fired! Ok, got order wrong but it's drive thru... Lack of customer service and respect from cashier who took my order at store #10480 and when I made a comment about the order being incorrect the two workers spoke something in spanish. The original cashier smacked her lips and grunted out-loud. They forgot to give me cups for my order and never made me feel welcome. Also, they saw me trying to get ice from the machine but it stopped working and they never came over to ask what was wrong. I will never eat at another burger king again. I am never rude or disrespectful to anyone outside my race so I expect the same treatment wherever I go. Burger King needs to spend money on training their staff on how to be polite, considerate and professional. I only went there because my nephew was hungry after school and it was close. So sad. I'm only one customer but I will make my voice heard about this. Love it really amazinig its Awsome the part i love is the Food!üòÄ Worst place to ever eat. I review a lot of places and HONESTLY rate them but I didn't even want to give this place 1 star that's how horrible they were. Not only did they give me food that looks a day old but they also cheated me out money. They charge me for 4 slices of cheese but only got two which is $0.60 Plus instead of getting 20 nuggets I only receive 18 for a triple Cheese Whopper I only received one slice of cheese on the top. On the Whopper I repeatedly asked for no lettuce no tomato and I received almost a full bun of lettuce. The lady at the register was young her name is Karen and she told me that I could not have my receipt because I received a double cheeseburger and not a triple Cheese Whopper so I paid the difference and they could not give me the receipt that showed me how much I paid and what I paid for. I will not be coming to this place ever again!!! Basic service. seats about 40. food was ok.  Not the cleanest place you will meet. Restrooms are particualrly dirty. Convenient to airport. Burger was wrong 2 times. 2nd time I go in to get some vegetables for my burger. The drive through guy tells the manager lady Im back cause they didnt put anything on my burger. She loudly and clearly says with an annoyed voice \"oh my gawd\". Then sees me standing there and walks away quickly. They were not busy. We were their only 2 customers at the time. Food was ok. Service was terrible. If they don't like their job then find another. Dont take it out on customer. Good food and service. No it's been longer than that, I don't do Burger King at all. I had the worst eat out experience in my whole life on this establishment, veronica guerrero on the drive thru is the most unethical and disrespectful individual i have ever met, she took the order screaming and yelling with an attitude..... i will proceed unto further actions with corporate. Do not go to this bk head to the one a mile down the road. Food was great, store was clean and newly redone They never get your order right The new manager has really changed this place and made it 100% better the food is great and service is fast the workers are nice. It's a very clean place Fish sandwich was terrible. It tasted like the tartar sauce was expired Fast drive thru Horrible!  Disregard the staff who obviously hate their job, the fact that they have yet to get an order correct, the food \"prepared\" puts the chain to shame.  Old lettuce, nasty tomatoes and burnt meat/fries?  I'll take my $20 elsewhere from now on. Parking lot Fries are good but that's it. I wish i could leave all stars blank, took 30 min. To get a burger, lettuce was 2 wks old, cannot be called fast food at this point, guy even had the nerve to text when i got to the window, didnt even know what order was mine one of the best burger kings Their chicken nuggets rate freezer burned If you like big burgers, Burger King is the place to go. Said they were closed at 11 am because they had a long line, lazy The food is fresh and delicious Made me sick to my stomach Chicken was  dry and over  cooked  . Pretty good fast food Love burger king Could have been better Fast service ok workers My cheese was not melted and the sandwich was cold. Coupons #2 no cheese lite lettuce extra pickles no mayo Clean, friendly staff and delicious nuggets Liked the Burger's. Good fresh quality food Good food, foos price Distgusting and Rude! Impossible Whopper Great Love burgers Typical Burger King. Amazing food Clean and fast and friendly Food always cold and never can get your order right. I like Burger King, just not this location. Hated it Service not great It's ok It's a burger king It's Burger King It's inside a gas station Over Charging Her name is Norma store number 10480 Very slow service They had Whoppers never have any tacos Was too slow Food was not frsh By far this is the worst Burger King app ever been to. There is never anyone in line at the drive-thru but it's always takes forever to get your food. I won't be going back Great food Terrible don't go there Good food The worst place ever, food tasted nasty ü§¢\n",
      "Even the Soda ü•§ was bad. Fast Service!!!! This has to be the least favorite Burger King restaurant I've visited out of all of them since when the whopper cost $1. The customer service is average but the food seems to be sub par compared to other Burger Kings. Google says they close at midnight...bet they never actually stay open that late. Went at 10:30 and they said they were closed. Al 100 siempre dejando huellas y est√≥magos felices (Translated by Google) good service. excellent\n",
